<h4>Yeah! You read that right.</h4>

I am thrilled to share the journey of creating a blazingly fast website using Next.js. From optimizing performance to leveraging the most advanced features of Next.js, this post will unveil the secrets behind achieving an impressive load time of just 0.3 seconds.

<h4>Why care about Performance ? </h4>

I mean, it's 2024 and developing a website is no longer just writing HTML, CSS and JS. Speed and Performance really do matter.

As observed with the continuous stream of JavaScript framework releases in 2022 and 2023, 2024 is anticipated to introduce a distinctive form of competitionâ€”a battle focused on speed and performance. As developers, our efforts extend beyond coding for functionality; we now actively engage in optimizing for speed.

<h4>How to Optimize Performance ? </h4>

Google introducted [`Web Vitals`](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/core-web-vitals) in 2020. Web Vitals is a set of metrics that measure real-world user experience for loading performance, interactivity, and visual stability of the page.

The core Web Vitals are :

- Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) - Loading
- First Input Delay (FID) - Interaction
- Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) - Visual Stability

Achieving favorable Web Vitals is imperative for developers to succeed in search rankings and provide an optimal user experience. The website that performs exceptionally well in these metrics will be prioritized and displayed prominently in search results.

<h4>How i made my blog wesbite load in 0.4 seconds ?</h4>

The answer is `I used Next.js`

I used the most advanced features of `Next.js 14` such as ` Server Side Rendering (SSR)`, `Static Site Generation(SSG)` , ` Incremental Static Regeneration(ISR)` , `Client Side Rendering (CSR)` , `Server Actions` and `Image Optimization` .

`Server Side Rendering (SSR)` uses the server resources. The initial HTML for the page is prerendered from the server, followed by "hydrating" the page in the browser (making it interactive). This allows us to send less JavaScript to the client, while maintaining the rendered HTML from the server.

> There are no silver bullets to Web performance. Simple static pages benefit being server-rendered with minimal Javascript.

`Static Site Generation(SSG)` is a technique in which we pre-render a page at build time. We fetch data from an external API or directly from a database, and pass this data down to the entire page as it's being generated during the build. Pages built with SSG can also be cached via CDN unlike pages built using SSR. So response time is significantly low compared to SSR. Gives better performance and SEO score.

All the pages in this wesbite are SSG pages, which mean all these pages are prerendered and ready to serve. That's why you experience almost no lag while moving across pages.

`Incremental Static Regeneration(ISR)` is an awesome technique introduced by Next.js to tackle stale or outdated pages problems in Static Site Generation. It allows us to revalidate our application without rebuilding the whole app. Thre are two types of revalidation `Time-based revalidation` and `On-demand revalidation` .

Time based revalidation automatically revalidate data after a certain amount of time has passed. This is useful for data that changes infrequently and freshness is not as critical. On-demand revalidation is manually revalidate data based on an event. This is useful when you want to ensure the latest data is shown as soon as possible.

`Server Actions` are asynchronous functions that are executed on the server. They can be used in Server and Client Components to handle form submissions and data mutations in Next.js applications. So now you can feel where we are heading to, we try do almost all work in server using server action. The best example would be form validation.

Next.js offers a Image component which is a extension of the standard HTML. This Image component is well optimised for performance and uses less bandwidth.
